SELECT and FORM :

1. Select: it indicates which column(s) you want to given the data for.
2. From : Specifies from which table(s) you want to select the colums.
notice the columns need to exist in this table

Note: if you want to be provided with the data from all columns in the table, you use "*", like so:

Eg: select * from orders;

Note that using select does not create a new table with these column in database, its just provide the data to you as the result, or output, of this command.

You will use the sql select statement in every query in this course, but you will be learning a few additional statements and operators that can be used along with them to ask more advanced question for your data.

If you see an error message after executing your query, no problem! Programmers get error all the time! Mistakes are opportunities to learn. :)
