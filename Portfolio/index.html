                Hey, gorgeous human! <b>Nitish</b> here. &#128075; <br />
                <br />
                Welcome to the online residence of some rather aesthetic
                stuff. &#128517; <br />
                I'm a Software Engineer working at infosys.com.<b>Hyderabad, India</b>.
                I like the peoples who respect their own time. &#128519;
                <br />
                <br />
                To give you an idea about the kind of work that I dabble
                in, I'm into <b>Interface</b>, <b>Experience</b> &
                <b>Graphic design</b>. If you think about it, design is what
                makes life, life. (P.S: I've never formally trained as a
                designer. I'm just trying to learn as much as I can from
                this beautiful thing called the internet! &#128516;) <br />
                Apart from design, I write
                <a href="https://github.com/nitish166" target="_blank">code</a>
                too. <br /><br />
